TODO: include how to run your system, including instructions on how to return the code & test cases for the given app

--HOW TO RUN--
The system should be run by providing an OpenAI API key to run all of the LLM processes. Once that is done, the application UI should ask you for the functional requirements, which are designated by the user. Once that is done, it is submitted through the "Run Cyber Defender" button, which then conducts processes simulatenously to generate the parsed input, the code itself, the comprehensive test suite, the test results, and the usage reports. All you have to do to check those is click on each tab as you need it, as the program will generate items instantaneously without a buffer.
